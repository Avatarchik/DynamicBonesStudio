A useful tool for quickly setting up dynamic bones with VRChat Avatars

# Getting started / How to use;

4. Click apply dynamic bones and confirm!

# Studio tab;
After applying your bones, you can switch to the studio tab to change the dynamic bone settings from one window.
If you make some changes you want to save in play mode, simply click the save button and then once you exit play mode, click the load button that appears. 

## Presets;
You can save and load presets for quick testing/configuring of avatars. 

To do so:

2. Select the preset by name from the dropdown and click "load"
